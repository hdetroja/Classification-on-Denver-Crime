# Classification-on-Denver-Crime

We will use the Denver Crime Data to predict whether the reported offense is a crime or not. We will be using 4 approaches i.e.<br>
1.Pocket Algorithm.<br>
2.Quadratic Discriminant Analysis(QDA).<br>
3.Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA).<br>
4.Linear Regression.<br>
Using these approaches we will classify the target value as is a crime or not a crime. We will be comparing the accuracy and other metrics of training and testing data for all the 4 approaches.
